Changed the project structure for Rasa projects initialized with the 
[CLI](./command-line-interface.mdx) (using the `rasa init` command): 
`actions.py` -> `actions/actions.py`. `actions` is now a Python package (it contains 
a file `actions/__init__.py`). In addition, the `__init__.py` at the 
root of the project has been removed.
